# Prerequisites

- **Python 3.13+** – the engine is developed and tested against Python 3.13.
- **Git** – required to clone the repository and obtain updates.
- **Supported platform tools** – Windows, macOS and Linux are supported; ensure your platform has access to the required command line utilities.
- **Game assets** – you must legally own the game data you intend to process.

The `runtime` directory bundled with the repository includes all Python dependencies, so a standard `pip install` step is not required.
