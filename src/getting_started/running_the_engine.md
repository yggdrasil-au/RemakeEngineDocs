# Running the Engine

Launch the interactive menu by executing:
```bash
python main.py
```
The CLI will prompt you to select a game, run initialization scripts and choose available operations.

A standalone `maker` executable is provided for environments where Python is not installed. It behaves the same as `main.py`.
