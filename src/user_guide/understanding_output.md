# Understanding Output

The engine prints colour-coded messages:

- **Green** – success or general information
- **Yellow** – warnings that may require attention
- **Red** – errors; the operation failed or aborted

Logs from called scripts are forwarded to the console. For persistent records, redirect output to a file when invoking the engine.
