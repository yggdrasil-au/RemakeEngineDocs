# Adding New Game Support

1. Create a directory under `RemakeRegistry/Games/` named after the game and platform.
2. Add an `operations.json` describing available operations.
3. Write any required scripts in a `Scripts/` subfolder.
4. Optionally provide an `init.py` to validate data on first run.
5. Test the module thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
