# Advanced User Input & Prompts

Operations support a prompt system for gathering runtime information. Prompt types include:

- `confirm` – yes/no questions optionally adding command-line flags
- `text` – free-form input with optional validation
- `checkbox` – select multiple options

Prompts can be conditional and their responses are exposed as placeholders for subsequent arguments.
